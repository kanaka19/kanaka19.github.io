                <p class="text-lg text-gray-700">As a dedicated mom and junior full-stack developer, I bring a unique blend of experience in creating user-focused solutions and managing the demands of parenthood. My journey into programming began with a curiosity to understand the mechanics behind the digital world, and since then, I've been on an exciting learning curve.
                  Equipped with a solid foundation in Java, JavaScript, CSS, Tailwind CSS, OOP, and React, I bridge front-end and back-end development for seamless application performance. I have a knack for problem-solving and an eye for detail, striving to create clean, efficient code that not only meets requirements but also inspires innovation.
                  I am eager to expand my skills and tackle new challenges in the realm of software development, bringing my expertise to new projects and collaborating with like-minded professionals. Outside of my professional endeavors, I proudly embrace the role of a dedicated mom. Balancing the demands of parenthood with my passion for coding has taught me the value of time management, perseverance, and adaptability—skills that I carry into every aspect of my life, both personal and professional.</p>
