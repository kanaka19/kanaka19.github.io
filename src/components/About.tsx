        I am a passionate software developer with a focus on Java and
        JavaScript. As a dedicated mom, I bring a unique perspective to my work,
        combining technical expertise with efficient time management and
        adaptability. My portfolio showcases projects where I have demonstrated
        proficiency in React, Spring, H2, Tailwind CSS, and cookies,
        highlighting my commitment to creating clean and engaging user
        experiences. In addition to my technical skills, I am well-versed in
        Agile methodologies, ensuring efficient project management and
        collaborative teamwork. My experience spans both front-end and back-end
        development, enabling me to bridge the gap between user interfaces and
        server-side functionality for seamless application performance. I am
        excited to leverage my skills and experiences to contribute positively
        to innovative projects and collaborative teams. My journey into
        programming began with a curiosity to understand the inner workings of
        software, and since then, I've been on an exciting learning curve.
        Balancing the demands of parenthood with my passion for coding has
        taught me the value of perseverance and adaptabilityâ€”skills that I carry
        into every aspect of my life, both personal and professional.
